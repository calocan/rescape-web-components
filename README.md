# rescape-web-components

This Rescape package is a collection of common components used by Rescape applications

## Running the App

### 1. Clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/calocan/rescape-web-components
cd rescape-web
```

Install the Graphcool CLI:

```sh
# Install Graphcool CLI
npm install -g graphcool
```

Once it's installed, you can deploy the Graphcool service based on the existing definition inside the [`server`](./server) directory:

```sh
cd server
yarn install
graphcool deploy
```

When prompted which cluster you want to deploy to, choose any of the **Shared Clusters** options (`shared-eu-west-1`, `shared-ap-northeast-1` or `shared-us-west-2`).

### 3. Connect the app with your GraphQL API

Paste the service ID (which you find in the generated `.graphcoolrc` file inside the `server` directory or by running `graphcool info`) into `./src/index.js` replacing the current placeholder `__SERVICE_ID__`. 

### 5. Install dependencies & run locally

```sh
cd ..
yarn install
yarn start # open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```
